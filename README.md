# direct_search_optimisation_sim
Interactive demo of Hooke_Jeeves and Powell algorithms used for direct-search function optimisation. The example functions are Sphere, Rosenbrock and Three Hump Camel.

The GUI is self explanatory, there is a description for everything, you can even plot the function if you want to gain more insight of how the optimisation process is going.
